/**
 * Confirms Flex payouts on their day, when the rule asks for it.
 *
 * Income used to be written the moment a block was logged, which put the
 * bank balance in the app days ahead of the real one. Now a payout is only
 * written on its Tuesday or Friday — for the expected amount, marked as
 * automatic — and can be corrected to what actually landed afterwards.
 *
 * Mounted once in the shell so it runs whichever page is open. Deposit ids
 * are derived from the payout day, so two phones doing this at once still
 * make one record.
