/**
 * Two phones, one household record.
 *
 * The cloud holds the finance state as a single document, and each phone
 * used to upload its whole copy. Whichever phone saved last won — so a spend
 * logged on one phone while the other had an unsynced edit was silently
 * overwritten, and the two never agreed.
 *
 * This is a three-way merge: the state both phones last agreed on (base),
 * this phone's copy (local) and the cloud's (remote). Every list is matched
 * by id:
 *  - added on either side → kept;
 *  - deleted on either side since base → gone;
 *  - changed on one side → that side's version;
 *  - changed on both → field by field, and for the running numbers — an
 *    account's balance, a debt's remaining amount — both changes are applied
 *    as deltas, because each side's transactions moved them independently.
 *
 * Between Us is recomputed from the merged history rather than merged as a
 * number. Without a base (the first sync after this shipped) nothing can be
 * told apart from an addition, so the two sides are unioned.
